GeoCoin 3.2

Simple cryptographic tokens with messaging for sharing and trading!

AS OF BLOCK 12314, The Kimoto Gravity Well has been implemented!

Defaults:

*RPC PORT 3990

*P2P PORT 3991

*TESTNET PORT 13991

This release is wholly different from GeoCoin 1.0 and 2.0.

It includes the following refinements:

New block chain--Yep, I told you it might happen. All old coins
are now gone, but hey, you can now cache for new ones! With the release
to the GroundSpeak community I thought it best to adjust and reboot,
I promise there will not be any further resets of the blockchain for GeoCoin
post release of 3.0.

Block target times changed to 3 minutes and block maturation to 25 confirms.

Difficulty adjustment has been altered to allow for CPU mining as long as possible.

New Graphics! Program updated with Caching themed icons and lingo.

Built-in Coin Creation System Improvements (Virtual Caching) 

QR Code Support

One-click Access to Command Line Console

Another thing you may notice is the decimals are gone--but really
that's just trickery. They are still there, but only viewable using
the Command Line Console for easy math, so values may go up or down
by a coin or two in your Collected balance.

GeoCoin is Free and Open Source and should not be considered "currency." 
To that end, 2.5% (25million) of all GeoCoins are pre-cached and held by the 
developer for use with GeoCoin faucets, giveaways, and other such things.
